## Title: PHP Web Application chosen 

## Status: Accepted 

## Context: There must be a web application that can present that data in the SQL tables

## Decision: The change proposed is to be able to view SQL data in a browsere

## Consequences: PHP is not the most user friendly language, however I have used it in another class so I find it beneficial to stay consistent
