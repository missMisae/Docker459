## Title: Apache Webserver Chosen 

## Status: Accepted 

## Context: A webserver is needed to host the web application, there was a PHP-apache bundle in docker so I chose to go with apache. 

## Decsion: the change proposed is being able to access a web application through the use of a server 

## consequences: I have never used apache, there could be a large unforseen problem in the future.
