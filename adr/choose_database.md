## Title: Choose MYSQL database for storing data 

## Status: Accepted 

## Context: A tool for data storage is necessary for the assignment. I learned SQL in a previous course and it is being used by many of my peers, so for the sake of staying consistent I will use MYSQL

## Decsion: The change that I propose is a method for storing data

## Consequences: MYSQL is very popular, however there are probably better/more modern tools I could use.
